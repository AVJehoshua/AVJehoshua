ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Jehoshua, a Junior Full Stack Developer. Prior to this, I taught computing to a variety of ages, which ultimately sparked my curiosity for all things tech! 

I have just completed an enlightening 16-week bootcamp at Makers, where i was challenged to re-think 'how to learn' and am eager to keep on building exciting projects!


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Javascript, Swift.
